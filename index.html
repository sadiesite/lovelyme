            <p>Becoming Pug property has been one of the happiest of accidents at our house. We have a granddaughter, Chris, 
        who as many teenagers are wont to do, decided/obsessed on getting a dog in 2012. The fact that we had at the time
        <em>six</em> cats (indoors, that is) was not a consideration of our single-minded tour director. Nor were such workaday
        things like walking the dog, paying for food, budgeting for veterinary care, etc., while pursuing one's Junior year of 
        High School. Or the fact that should she seek higher education, she would be gone 95% of the time. Also, that a degree program 
        might actually outlive some pets out there at various rescues. If you're thinking of a puppy, you're committing to 12 to 15 years...</p>
            <p>Spouse and I knew of course, we were going to be the parents. Chris is wonderful, but at 16 didn't realize the part 
        about life being the thing that happens while you are planning. While she really wanted a large dog, she let on that she
        was interested in a Dachshund. She had a willing conspirator in my wife, who had been saying for several years she would also like a small dog. 
        We started out looking on the adoption site <a href="http://www.petfinder.com">Petfinder.com</a>.<!--make links for petfinder and poor animals--> 
        That site prompts users to enter a zipcode before searching, giving results by distance from one's home zip. We live in a part of 
        The Bronx which is about two-thirds attached row houses, with little or no yard space, and it never occurred to us someone 5 minutes 
        away had a rescue established in her house. So for giggles we called up <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/NY587.html">The 
        Poor Animals of Saint Francis</a>, and were greeted by a lady called Marie. She had a bunch of kittens, several mutts, and had just 
        been presented with a trio of Pugs, one of which had been adopted. She said she was smitten with one of the other two, can I come over
        and introduce you to her sister?</p>
            <p>We were truly blindsided a little while later. She came over with the most sweet-natured little dog imaginable. None of us 
        had been around a Pug, aside from one occasionally scooting by on the sidewalk. Such a charmer! And this soulful look in her 
        big, bulging eyes. My second thought was 'are the cats going to aim there first?', but they seemed on first meeting to take 
        a benign approach to her presence. She was almost 3 years old and in good health. At the time, Chris had several friends staying with 
        us, and it seemed like universal agreement that this dog, then named Sage, was just too good-natured to pass up. We did the due diligence
        paperwork with Marie and she jumped into Chris' bed.</p>

            <p>Dogs are a thing. Our daughter had kept several, years earlier, but she lived with many issues which kept her from properly caring
        for them. One, who I enjoyed very much and miss to this day, took off out the front door and disappeared down the driveway. I looked 
        around our surrounding neighborhood, but never saw him again. I should point out that we became stereotypical cat people, with too 
        many of them, and an overwhelming emotional attachment starting in Spring 2000, a little while after we had no dogs in the house.
        I will bloviate later about cats and their relationship with the Pug. In spite of the apparent superior attitude displayed by cats, 
        a dog will <em>de facto</em> run your house. I say this because cats tend to be independent, will prefer a cardboard box to a $200 
        cat tree, etc. They don't much care about the things you want to do to spoil them. It's not precisely a 'rule by weakness' vibe, 
        you'll just <strong>want</strong> to do everything for the dog.</p>
        
            <p>Which is how things began to play out after Sage arrived. Chris did, in spite of loads of work in Honors classes, lavish attention
        on her. She loved being groomed, bathed and pampered.  Looking back, I cannot recall the reason, but Chris decided one day early on 
        to change her name to Sadie, and it has been ever since. Sadie had been kept in a studio apartment, which her previous person
        attempted to use as a puppy mill. Working pretty hard here to keep my mouth shut...anyway, that floor plan meant she had to learn 
        about stairs, as we live on 2 floors. We had to acclimate her to the outside world, generally; Cars, big dogs, bugs, rain, heat, 
        you name it. We didn't need to do much dogproofing in our house because catproofing is 99% identical, basically anti-chewing measures.
        She turned out to be a natural with potty training, just walk in the mid-AM and again after dinner. I think in 5 years she's presented
        us with 5 or 6 accidents. Sadie probably sleeps two-thirds of the time, and I bet it's a 'nervous' tired borne out of vigilance and loyalty
        to her people. Pugs more than most dogs seem to be super loyal, and undergo separation anxiety, sometimes if you only step away for a moment. Her
        desire to snuggle with my wife has actually caused the three of us to sleep like a pretzel at times. I have read about the
        fearlessness of Pugs but have experienced the opposite; Although she'll bark at strangers or other dogs at a distance, she fears 
        our neighbor's tiny Maltese.</p>
            <p> After about a year, Chris became wrapped up in school to the point that Sadie began to favor spending time with my wife Marie.
        This is a pretty good time to consider something Mr. Soprano once said: "There's no gettin' out."
        This is really when we began to experience the loyalty and separation thing. I don't have any recording device in the car, but I'll take
        Marie's word for it that she starts to cry when I get out. She's <em>frantic</em> when Marie gets out! Our experience with
        learned behavior and anticipation seems to reflect this intensity. When we're about to leave the house, she'll start yipping and shrieking when Marie
        shuts the laptop. This is all because she loves riding in a car like no other creature! When we leave and cannot bring her, trust me,
        you have never seen <em>her</em> kind of hairy eyeball.</p>
            <p>Much of Sadie's social life is spent hanging out near Washington Square in Manhattan, when we are out selling books. Loneliness is not good 
        for anyone, Pugs especially, and it's usually cooler outside than in our house. She looks forward to the ride, even if it's a crawl. 
        Students regularly stop by to see her & say hi. Locals come by with their dogs who like to greet & sniff. Kim Wolf from 
        <a href="http://www.beyondbreed.com">Dogs of New York</a> came by once or twice. People actually ask to photograph her!</p><!--link dogs of ny facebook?-->
            <p>Chris recently graduated from LIU and is, for now, walking and exercising 20 dogs weekly in Brooklyn. We visited her there last night with Sadie,
        and she recognizes her of course, but she clearly shows Marie as her emotional center.</p>

            <p><strong>Preamble/Disclaimer:</strong> I'm not a veterinarian, the host of Wild Kingdom or anything. Use common sense, your reality
        may vary. Don't sue me. Look elsewhere for basics common to all dogs.</p>
        <p>I suppose the most basic things would be clean fold above the nose, wipe paws and ears with damp cloth daily. Also clean teeth daily, 
        with the fingertip thingie or kids soft toothbrush.</p>
            <p>Feeding is the answer to several Pug-specific problems. Pugs very easily become obese. We learned almost at once that a Pug is a 
        goldfish with fur; they will eat everything in sight, especially people food. She began after some months to revolt against even 
        high-end dog food, because my wife began letting her eat more and more of her own (Italian mother=smothering provider of food to 
        offspring). I became known as the disaffected private chef, as I began to cook for her. That way, I could keep a better eye on exactly
        what she eats. I have come to believe 'your favorite Agribusiness villain here' is less of a threat than opaque consumer protections of pet 
        food; I know of no dog that has filed a lawsuit, never heard about a cat waltzing into an FDA hearing, and practically no owner will 
        really go to the wall for Fido, people are just not able.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feed lean meat and some vegetable. Google healthy veggies for dogs; maybe a little rice but don't be a grainiac.</li>
            <li>Feed whole foods. Processing isn't good for you; it might be fatal for your pet. Find peanut butter made from just peanuts, 
            it might be $4. But $2 regular stuff has xylitol, a sweetener not even on the label, which will sicken your dog.</li>
            <li>Do <strong>not</strong> overfeed a Pug. Ours is at a stable 18 lbs on about a cup twice daily.</li>
            <li>Don't scrimp on good veggies, and don't worry about the Pug rep for flatulence; Better healthy & normal than an imbalanced 
            diet.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>Oh yes, bring in da noise, bring in da funk! More than a few farts, you must consider the dog's anal sacs. These sacs, adjacent to the dog's
        anus, will need to be expressed of their contents maybe at least twice a year. The main symptom is when Pug starts scooting, grinding his/her 
        rear end against the floor. You can find out how via Google, or ask the vet; Do not allow these to become infected, surgery may be required, 
        and you can only imagine the pain poor Pug will endure.</p>
        <p>Pugs develop joint problems as they age unless they are moderately active. Don't go jogging with a pug, a simple walk is perfect.
        Sadie & I get in a little less than a mile almost every day, plus a quarter or so in the evening. BTW if you're diabetic it will help
        your metabolism. We started this about a year after we adopted- curiously, right around the time Chris went to College- and she lost about 
        3 lbs. For many of us 2-legged types that's 30 lbs or so.</p>
            <p>Pugs have evolved into a flat-faced form, an endearing appearance to many people. This evolutionary path includes a long, soft 
        palate and scrunched respiratory passages. This also has produced a frequently hilarious persona, a grunting, gurgling, snorting 
        (and <em>snoring</em>) creature. But, please laugh with, not at; Pugs have respiratory challenges. Warm climes are rough on these 
        dogs. There will be panting; Remember, dogs can't sweat! On hot days, get your walk in early in the AM, and plan on a quick, cool (not stone cold) shower
        for doggie after you're done. A map of Pug Heaven surely includes Atlantic Canada, New Zealand, Seattle, Scotland...you get the picture.</p><!--para fleas here-->
            <p>There will be fleas, if Pug lives where there is above-zero humidity, and anything resembling home heating. They will make the entire 
        household miserable, and bring tapeworm among other nasties. Sprays employing pyrethrins are fairly effective; They are also effective
        at harming your pet's nervous system. Roughly the same holds true for topicals, which you put on pet's skin monthly. Have a tiny bit in 
        <em>your</em> iced tea, and tell me all about the music in the waiting room at the poison control center. Preachy Me says run your vacuum
        every day, all over everywhere. If you have allergies or asthma, guess what, you'll probably feel better. Get an old school flea comb 
        with tines close enough to just pass a sheet of paper. Comb the entire Pug at least daily! All kinds of tiny schmutz will come off, you'll 
        remove dead fur, and Pug's skin will respond to this by exuding just a bit of natural oils. Your Pug will be super-comfy, and will
        bond with you through grooming time.</p>

            <p>I suppose all work is 'work in progress'. Animals have personalities, and form relationships. Whether personalities change or not
        is an ongoing argument within psychology. There is <em>no</em> argument that relationships change. Sadie's Godmother was concerned 
        about her well-being from the start, mostly about cats swiping at her eyes, and mentions it from time to time when we see her.
        There's some disconnect in their perception of each other's gestures, yet somehow our pets seem to be blessed with the ability to get
        along. The fact that they are all dedicated sleepers has probably been a great help. We have kept indoors 9 cats over the years. 8 of
        the 9 indoor cats have known the dog, and I believe 7 have taken a swat towards her face. But having witnessed all these, they seem to
        have been half-hearted, as if they weren't meant to truly harm. In 5 years I don't believe the cats have broken her skin. On balance, 
        I can only recall once when she growled at one of the cats; I think she was chewing on a bone and didn't want competition. </p>
            <p>I only wish I were more agile with the camera on my phone. On a couple of occasions, our dear departed Boots, a Tuxedo who came & adopted us, would
        sink her nose deep in Sadie's ears and clean them! The look on Sadie's face was memorable. Marie asked us to foster a domestic Longhair 
        who's turned out to share Boots' den mother vibe. We decided after a day or so to adopt her, and she curls up on the bed all the time 
        with Sadie. This is a contrast to life with one of our first cats, Samantha, an outwardly unhappy Tabby with a taste for screeching. 
        She wasn't aggressively mean towards Sadie, but if any of us were hanging out with her (or with any other cat), she'd physically nudge 
        in front looking for affection. We wonder a little about our youngest, Argo, who is 5 this summer. When Chris asked to adopt him as a 
        kitten, we did not consider the importance of his social learning curve. Cats learn their social ways mostly from others roughly their
        own age, and he came into a home with cats 8 to 12 years old. His concept of play is occasionally rough because he never had a partner 
        in 'playfighting'. He just innocently does things sometimes which seem outlandish (<em>truly</em> my doppelganger), and it's a case of
        'wait and see' as far as behavior around the dog. Argo has turned out, fully grown, to be three quarters or so the size of all his 
        companion cats. Relative size is also a player in everybody's behavior; All but one of the cats are about the same overall dimensions 
        as Sadie. Physically, they just don't want much conflict.</p>
            <p>Animals are surely sensitive creatures. Seven years ago, Tolstoy, a semi-feral cat we took in was killed by a car near our house. Every day when 
        we walk, Sadie pauses where I found his body. Sometimes for a few moments, sometimes a minute or more, and she will only do this while
        we are returning home, not on the way out. I cannot offer any explanation for this, other than that Sadie must have a spiritual nature.
        She somehow knows. Our eldest, Snowflake, is mostly a loner, but now and then will just show up and brush his head against Sadie's shoulder; It's 
        scent marking, a way of saying 'You're part of my inner circle'.
